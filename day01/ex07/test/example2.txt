"Protoss Commander, I am Admiral Alexei Stukov of the United Earth Directorate. 
We are here to take control of the Terran Dominion and all of its outlying colonies.
You are in direct violation of Terran space and have openly attacked Terran troops. 
Lower your shields and power down your weapons systems.
The UED will be taking custody of your ships and whatever spoils you have garnered from
this planet."
