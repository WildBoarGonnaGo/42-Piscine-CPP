"Orks Song - Ere we go"
Ere we go, ere we go, ere we go.
Ere we go, ere we go, cross the Kosmos.
Ere we go, ere we go, ere we go.
Ere we go, ere we go, throo infinity.
Ere we go, ere we go, ere we go.
Ere we go, ere we go, cross the Kosmos.
Ere we go, ere we go, ere we go.
Don't know where we're goin' til we get there.
